            Salvation by works is a doctrine taught in the early Roman Catholic Church—as well as Eastern Orthadox churches, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and Jehovah's Witnesses—which stated that good works contributes to a person's salvation, and that faith in the sacrifice of Jesus is not soley sufficient to save one from Hell.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            This doctrine was challenged during the Protestant Reformation, particularly by Martin Luther, who emphasized justification by faith alone (sola fide), citing Ephesians 2:8-9. The Reformers argued that salvation is a gift of God's grace, received through faith, and not earned by human efforts or works.

        <paragraph>
            Most modern churches affirm salvation by grace through faith (sola fide), while recognizing that good works are a natural outcome (often coined "fruit") of genuine faith.
