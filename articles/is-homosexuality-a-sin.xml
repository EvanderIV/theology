            A common misconception by non-Christians is that homosexuality itself is a sin according to the Bible. However, the Bible only ever condemns homosexual acts, not the feelings or temptations that come with homosexuality (Note the use of "active" language in 1 Timothy 1:10, 1 Corinthians 6:9, and Leviticus 20:13).

        <paragraph>
            Neither being homosexual nor homosexual acts prevent one from being a Christian or receiving the gift of salvation, though practicing homosexuality with the mindset that God will forgive it is a sign of an unrepentant heart which has not been transformed by Christ's sacrifice and the gift of salvation (Romans 6:1-2).
